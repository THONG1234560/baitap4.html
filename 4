    <p>A <strong> website</strong> (also written as a <strong> web site</strong>) is one or more <span style="color: blue;"> web pages</span> and related content that is identified by a common <span style="color: blue;">domain name</span> and published on at least one <span style="color: blue;">web server</span>. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or <span style="color: blue;">social media</span>. <span style="color: blue;">Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a <span style="color: blue;">home page</span>. The <span style="color: blue;">most-visited</span> sites are <span style="color: blue;">Google, YouTube</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">Facebook</span>.<br>
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span style="color: blue;">World Wide Web</span>. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <span style="color: blue;">private network</span>, such as a company's internal website for its employees. <span style="color: blue;">Users</span> can access websites on a range of devices, including <span style="color: blue;">desktops</span>, <span style="color: blue;">laptops</span>, <span style="color: blue;">tablets</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">smartphones</span>. The <span style="color: blue;">app</span> used on these devices is called a web <span style="color: blue;">web browser</span>.</p>
